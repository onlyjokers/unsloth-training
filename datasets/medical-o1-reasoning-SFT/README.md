## News
[2025/02/22] We released the [distilled dataset from Deepseek-R1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/Medical-R1-Distill-Data) based on medical verifiable problems. You can use it to initialize your models with the reasoning chain from `Deepseek-R1`.
[2024/12/25] We open-sourced the medical reasoning dataset for SFT, built on medical verifiable problems and an LLM verifier.

## Introduction
This dataset is used to fine-tune HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM designed for advanced medical reasoning. This dataset is constructed using GPT-4o, which searches for solutions to [verifiable medical problems](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-verifiable-problem) and validates them through a medical verifier. 


For details, see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18925) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1).
